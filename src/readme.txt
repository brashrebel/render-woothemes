== Description ==

[Woothemes](https://woothemes.com/) is a theme company which produces quality WordPress themes. [Render](http://renderwp.com/?utm_source=Render%20Woothemes&utm_medium=readme%20link&utm_campaign=Render%20Woothemes%20Readme
) is a WordPress plugin which creates shortcodes AND makes them easier to use. This extension for both Woothemes takes the
shortcodes created by the Woothemes framework which is included in all of their themes and integrates them with the intuitive
interface from Render.

Now you can find all the available Woothemes shortcodes, view and utilize all their available parameters, and insert them
into your content, easier than ever before and without ever touching code (even shortcodes)! Plus, Render enables
live previewing of supported shortcodes in the editor so you never even SEE those ugly shortcodes. Instead, you
instantly see exactly what your shortcodes are returning and are able to manipulate them with ease.

This plugin requires both Woothemes and Render.

== Installation ==

Using this plugin is very simple. All you have to do is:

1. Upload the `render-woothemes` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
