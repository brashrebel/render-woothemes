# Render Woothemes
### v1.0.0

Woothemes has been producing top notch WordPress themes for years now and one of the coolest parts of the Woo Framework which each theme
is built on is the library of useful shortcodes included. These shortcodes enable users to insert useful elements such as
buttons, boxes, accordions, social buttons and more.

Now, with the Render and the Render Woothemes extension, using these shortcodes is easier than ever before.

3. Get this plugin
4. Upload this plugin to `wp-content/plugins` and your new theme to `wp-content/themes`
5. Activate each of them in your WordPress dashboard
6. Go crazy

## Key features

Here's a basic rundown of what this plugin does so that you'll know what to look for:

* Adds each Woothemes shortcode to the Render interface
* Categorizes and tags each Woothemes shortcode so that they become searchable in the Render modal
* Creates easy to use input fields for all available shortcode parameters
* Generates a live preview in the editor of all Woothemes shortcodes
* Includes all Woothemes shortcodes in the Render widget so they can be added to sidebars
